    <p>Ingredients

        3 cups all purpose flour
        5 teaspoon baking powder
        1 ½ teaspoon salt
        ½ teaspoon baking soda
        ½ cup cold butter or vegetable shortening
        1 - 1 ¼ cup cold buttermilk
        melted butter or heavy cream to brush the tops
    
    Instructions
    
        Preheat the oven to 450°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
        Sift together the dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl.
        Cube the butter or shortening then cut it into the dry ingredients using a pastry blender or pulse in a food processor. Cut until it becomes crumbly and resembles peas.
        Mix in 1 cup cold buttermilk, just until the crumbs are thoroughly moistened. Add up to ¼ cup additional buttermilk, if needed. The dough shouldn't be overly wet but, slightly sticky. 
        Roll or pat out on a lightly floured surface about ¾-1 inch thick. Cut into rounds using a 2-inch cookie cutter dipped in flour. Do not twist the dough with the cutter. Cut the dough, then lift the cookie cutter up.  Re-roll any scraps and repeat.
        Place biscuits 2 inches apart on the baking sheet. Brush the tops with melted butter or heavy cream.
        Bake biscuits at 450°F for 13-15 minutes until lightly golden and puffed.
        Brush with melted butter after removing from the oven. Serve immediately. </p>
