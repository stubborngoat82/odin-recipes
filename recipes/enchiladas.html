        Ingredients For beef and cheese enchiladas
        
            corn tortillas for the amount of enchiladas there should be enough sauce to make 3-4 dozen
            2 c
            shredded cheddar cheese per dozen enchiladas
            ENCHILADA SAUCE
            2 Tbsp
            olive oil
            2-3 clove
            garlic, minced
            1 md
            yellow or white onion, diced
            1 tsp
            oregano (I used Mexican oregano but regular is fine)
            3 Tbsp
            chili powder
            1/2 tsp
            basil
            2 tsp
            cumin
            1 tsp
            chipotle chili pepper (this is spicy, it can be reduced to taste)
            2-3 tsp
            salt
            1 tsp
            black pepper
            1 can
            tomato sauce, 8 oz.
            4-5 c
            water, divided
            meat, you can use any meat - ground meat, shredded chicken
            diced onions to top enchiladas (optional)

            DIRECTIONS

    SAUCE – in a saucepan, combine oil and flour over medium heat to create a paste. After a minute or so, add your enchilada sauce, chicken broth and salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 30-45 minutes. At around the 40 minute mark, add in the cilantro.
    MEAT – While the sauce is simmering, brown the hamburger meat along with the onions. When cooked through, drain fat. Stir in the green chillies, salt, chili powder, ground cumin and red pepper flakes.
    Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
    Pour about 1/2 cup of sauce on the bottom of a 9 x 13 inch casserole dish.
    In a small baking pan (I used a round cake pan), pour some of the sauce into the bottom. Dip each tortilla into the sauce so that both sides are coated, then add the ground beef mixture, shredded cheddar, and a few sliced green onions.
    Roll up the tortilla nice and tight and place in the bottom of the pan.
    Continue this process until you have no more tortillas and filling left. Pour remaining sauce over the top of the enchiladas and top with remaining shredded cheddar.
    Bake for around 20 minutes. You’ll know it’s done when the cheddar cheese is all gooey and melted!
    Top it off by adding a little fresh green onion and cilantro, and a dollop of sour cream.
